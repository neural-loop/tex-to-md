% % Is to plan it out, and never let it die
% % A weapon chosen, a place to hide
% % A story crafted, and alibis to provide

% % Silent steps, a heart that races
% % A mind consumed by the darkness, no traces
% % The victim unaware, unsuspecting prey
% % A victim chosen, for a reason to slay

% % The trigger pulled, the deed is done

% % Is to take a life, and break the rules
% % But in the end, it's just a game
% % A game that leads to eternal shame.
