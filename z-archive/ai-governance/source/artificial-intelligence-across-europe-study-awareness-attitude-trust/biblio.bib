abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has widespread societal implications, yet social scientists
are only beginning to study public attitudes toward the technology. Existing studies
find that the public's trust in institutions can play a major role in shaping the
regulation of emerging technologies. Using a large-scale survey (N=2000), we examined
Americans' perceptions of 13 AI governance challenges as well as their trust in governmental,
corporate, and multistakeholder institutions to responsibly develop and manage AI.
While Americans perceive all of the AI governance issues to be important for tech
companies and governments to manage, they have only low to moderate trust in these
institutions to manage AI applications.},

abstract = {As the influence and use of artificial intelligence (AI) have grown and its transformative
potential has become more apparent, many questions have been raised regarding the
economic, political, social, and ethical implications of its use. Public opinion plays
an important role in these discussions, influencing product adoption, commercial development,
research funding, and regulation. In this paper we present results of an in-depth
survey of public opinion of artificial intelligence conducted with 10,005 respondents
spanning eight countries and six continents. We report widespread perception that
AI will have significant impact on society, accompanied by strong support for the
responsible development and use of AI, and also characterize the public's sentiment
towards AI with four key themes (exciting, useful, worrying, and futuristic) whose
prevalence distinguishes response to AI in different countries.},
