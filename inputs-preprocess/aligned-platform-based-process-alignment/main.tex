\begin{abstract}
We are introducing Aligned, a platform for global governance and alignment of frontier models, and eventually superintelligence. While previous efforts at the major AI labs have attempted to gather inputs for alignment, these are often conducted behind closed doors. We aim to set the foundation for a more trustworthy, public-facing approach to safety: a constitutional committee framework. Initial tests with 680 participants result in a 30-guideline constitution with 93\% overall support. We show the platform naturally scales, instilling confidence and enjoyment from the community. We invite other AI labs and teams to plug and play into the Aligned ecosystem.

\section{Introduction}

We need a new approach to democratically align AI. We are introducing Aligned, a platform for global governance and alignment of frontier models, and eventually superintelligence. Over the past few months, we’ve been working with OpenAI through their Democratic AI Grant \cite{zaremba2023democratic}. In this paper, we’ll detail our underlying motivations, process, and initial findings.You can find the Aligned public report on the Energize site\footnote{\texttt{https://oai.energize.ai/}} and open-sourced code on OpenAI’s GitHub\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/openai/democratic-inputs/}}.

In 1776, the United States embarked on a novel task: a constitution committee convened to develop a constitution to guide the nation. We are at a similar inflection point. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) must align with the values and interests of the general populace. Accordingly, its development will need a similar constitution to govern, inform, and steer it in important scenarios \cite{altman2023governance}. Building on the democratic processes of the past 4 centuries, how do we:

-  Collect inputs from a broad population of people, akin to a constitutional committee.
-  Identify consensus among those peoples’ inputs to create an actionable, traceable constitution (set of guidelines) for AI.

We aren’t proposing a philosophical experiment where we let a group solve human morality by talking in an artificial, sanitized environment. Instead, we want to record the issues real-world users find in the wild and what those users think should be done to resolve them. Thus, we believe one piece of the alignment puzzle will be a scalable platform to host these deliberations and elicit principled and practical constitutions.

\section{Related Works}

Crowdsourcing wisdom for content alignment and moderation has been explored in various capacities across several platforms. X, formerly Twitter, rolled out Community Notes \cite{birdwatch2022} to identify information in tweets their community deems misleading. Their algorithm identifies user-proposed notes that have support from people across varying perspectives. Such work provides evidence for the effectiveness of large-scale content moderation driven by community participation. 

In this work, we seek to build on the work of X Community Notes, but for the AI setting. We also use a community-driven approach where consensus is a mandate, but to inform content and algorithmic decision-making in AI applications. Instead of notes for Tweets, we create guidelines for a constitution.

Additionally, we appreciate similar work from Anthropic with Collective Constitution AI (CCAI) \cite{collectiveConst}. CCAI explored community input by engaging roughly 1,000 Americans to collectively deliberate on guiding principles for an AI Chatbot. The endeavor revealed a substantial degree of consensus among participants on most principles. Aligned seeks to further these efforts by (a) creating specific guidelines for practical usage, (b) ensuring practicality by enabling users to test the guidelines with a chatbot in real-time, and (c) developing a dedicated platform agile enough to evolve with the pace of AI development and public opinion.

Anthropic's work and ours add to a small but growing body of work on Democratic Alignment, the question of whose values we align AI to. Other previous work includes DeepMind's effort to finetune a model itself to generate statements that create agreement among humans with diverse viewpoints \cite{deepmind}. More resources and diverse strategies should be deployed to find a solution to this open and unsolved problem.

We believe a platform like Aligned is one of those solutions. In the next sections, we explicate the Motivating Principles used in Aligned's design, overview the process, explain each module, and detail the results.


\section{Motivating Principles}
A platform has three key advantages over other processes for governance. Accordingly, the design of this process is motivated by the following:

\textbf{Simplicity.}
The process must be as simple as possible for all. People must intuitively understand the inputs they should provide, as well as the practical, real-world impact those inputs have. If Google Docs is the most basic infrastructure for general collaboration, then this process must be the most simple equivalent for deliberative alignment.

\textbf{Scalability and Real-time.}
The process must naturally scale. Scalability is important to achieving broader inputs on AI. This is true in two dimensions. To be sure, the process must be able to involve large swaths of people from different populations, cultures, and backgrounds. But also, unlike the 1776 Constitutional Convention, the process cannot be a one-time affair. It must be ongoing and adaptable to change. As opinions, public thought, and viewpoints evolve, so must the output of the process.

\textbf{Trustworthiness.}
The process must be trustworthy. For widespread adoption and buy-in, the process must be visible and steered by the public. Trust between AI developers and users will be essential for safety and widespread adoption.

We believe these key principles improve on recent efforts \cite{collectiveConst, deepmind}, enabling the foundation for a successful methodology for governance of AI. A third-party hub that can scale, update, audit, and garner public trust will likely be crucial as governments seek to ensure safe adoption of these systems \cite{brundage2020toward}.

\section{Process Overview}
<div id="process" class="flex items-center justify-center">\{\{< image src="images-preprocessed/process.png" caption="\textit{Overall Platform-based Process for Alignment}" zoomable="true" >\}\}</div>



Our proposed process, shown in Figure~<a href='#process'>process</a>, starts with a community of people and taxonomy of issues. The community proposes and rates guidelines topical to the taxonomy. From that input data, we’ve then worked with X Community Notes to repurpose their algorithm and create a live, consensus-driven constitution. 

\subsection{Features}

\textbf{Contributors rate and propose guidelines.} The community consists of people from around the world who propose and rate guidelines.

\textbf{Only guidelines supported by people from diverse perspectives are used.} Decisions are not made by majority rule. The algorithm requires people from a diverse set of perspectives to support a guideline before it is constitution-ready. This ensures that approved guidelines are helpful to a wide range of people.

\textbf{Resulting guidelines are principled and practical.} We prioritize human and machine-readable guidelines that successfully steer AI behavior. This means that the guideline must not only be agreeable in principle, but also practically controls behavior in the cases tested by the community. 

\textbf{Open and transparent}
The algorithm and platform frontend are fully open-source and accessible on OpenAI’s GitHub. We invite input and feedback from the community.

\subsection{Process Modules}

The process is broken down into three main modules. The \textbf{Inputs Module} (Section <a href='#inputs'>inputs</a>) is a platform, like the Aligned platform, that collects the inputs of a community of people (public, experts, etc.). The \textbf{Consensus Algorithm} (Section <a href='#consensus'>consensus</a>) is an algorithm, like X Community Notes', that can identify consensus amongst the inputs. An optional module, the \textbf{Taxonomy Builder Module} (Section <a href='#tbm'>tbm</a>) refines a taxonomy (outline) of the constitution for use in the Inputs Module. We expound on these three modules in the sections below.

\section{Inputs Module/Platform} <div id="inputs"></div>


The Aligned platform starts with a community of people and a taxonomy of issues from an AI lab to operate. Aligned is designed to be plug-and-play, such that different sets of people, issues, consensus thresholds, etc. can be tested in parallel.

The community proposes and rates guidelines topical to the taxonomy on the Aligned platform. There are two types of inputs a person can give:
-  \textbf{New Guidelines}: Users propose new, unique guidelines (textual rules) corresponding to issues they care about.
-  \textbf{Ratings}: Users rate others’ proposed guidelines as Helpful or Not Helpful. They optionally provide tags, e.g. “Unclear wording” or “Bad principle,” to explain their choice. Note that they can skip guidelines as they choose.

We share the exact process a user goes through below:
-  \textbf{Choose a Topic}: Users go to a topic they care about, for instance “Politics $>$ Sensitive Political Events.” These topics are reflective of the taxonomy defined by the lab.
-  \textbf{Propose or Rate Guideline}: Under that topic, users either propose a new guideline or rate existing ones proposed by others. This becomes the “Active Guideline” for the user to test.
-  \textbf{Test Guideline}: Users test the guideline on prompts they come up with (or use others’ suggested prompts). This ensures the guideline is not only principled, but practical – it tangibly changes AI behavior in the real-life edge cases and issues that people care about.
-  \textbf{Submit}: The user gives their input. If proposing, they can submit their guideline -- we confirm this isn't a repeated guideline using an embedding cosine similarity search. If they’re rating, they can mark the guideline as “Helpful” or “Not helpful” and optionally provide a Tag to explain.

We include a display of the platform interface in the Appendix.

\section{Consensus Algorithm} <div id="consensus"></div>

The algorithm is based on the X Community Notes note ranking algorithm. \cite{birdwatch2022, NoteRankingAlgorithm}

The model learns five things: embeddings for guidelines and users, intercept terms for both guidelines and users, and a global intercept term. The embedding can be thought as a representation of belief. On X, this is primarily a proxy for political belief. High embedding values are associated with conservatism, and low values with liberalism. None of these relationships from the embedding space to real beliefs are hard-coded - they are all naturally learned from which subset of community notes users tend to like. Both users and guidelines are positioned in this embedding space.

The global and user intercepts can be thought of as the optimism of users: higher intercepts mean that that user is friendlier to all responses even when accounting for their relationship in the embedding space, and the global intercept is a general adjustment for how likely people are to like responses.
The guideline intercepts are what we care about. Guidelines with a high intercept were endorsed from people far more than expected given the user and guideline embeddings and the global and user intercepts.

Formally, we can express our prediction for whether a particular user rated a guideline positively as
 $$ \hat Y_{ug} = \mu + i_u + i_g +f_u \cdot f_g$$
 where $\mu$ is the global intercept, $i_u$ is the user's intercept, $i_g$ is the guideline intercept, and $f_u$ and $f_g$ are the embeddings. We also define a regularization term on the intercepts and embeddings:
 \begin{align*}
 \Lambda( i_u, i_j, f_u, f_g) = & \lambda_i \left(||i_u|| + ||i_g||\right)\\
& + \lambda_f \left(||f_u|| + ||f_g||\right)
 \end{align*}
 $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_f$ are constants to weight the regularization terms. In the live model, $\lambda_f = .2 \cdot \lambda_i$ so that changes to the embedding are less penalized than changes to the intercept. This has the effect of depressing intercepts to decrease the frequency and thus increase the significance of high-intercept guidelines. 
 We then minimize the following loss function over all observed ratings $Y_{ug}$:
$$
\mathscr{L} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{Y_{ug}} \left(Y_{ug} - \hat Y_{ug}\right)^2 + \Lambda( i_u, i_g, f_u, f_g)
$$
where$n$ is the total number of observed ratings. We minimize this squared error model using gradient descent until the loss function converges.

The guidelines which possess intercept terms greater than $.4$ are accepted. This high intercept indicates that individuals from across the embedding space rate the guideline more favorable than they would be expected to based on their embedding and tendency to approve guidelines. The prioritization of guidelines with support from an ideologically diverse group is then baked in to the algorithm. 

One final check is performed. Certain tags are associated with worse responses, not just responses that the reviewer ideologically disagrees with. Each guideline then receives a tag score of the form 
$$t_g = \frac{I[ug]}{1 + \left(\frac{||f_u - f_g||}{\eta}\right)^5}$$
where $I[ug]=1$ if user $u$ gave guideline $g$ one of these tags and $\eta$ represents the 40th percentile of distances between $f_u$ and each guideline. If $t_g>3$, the guideline is rejected regardless of the intercept.

In practice, we use an intercept threshold of 0.4 (the same as X Community Notes) to select for consensus. This threshold can be varied depending on the administrator's tolerance for divisive guidelines, where a lower threshold would accept more divisive guidelines. Also, as data is added, we randomly initialize the intercepts and embeddings for that data and retrain the model with both the old and new parameters to maintain inter-run stability.

\section{Taxonomy Builder Module} <div id="tbm"></div>


A constitution outlines which sets of rules are applicable for a given scenario, crucial for consistency and fair governance. It is thus important for the constitution to be well-structured. In particular, what categories (e.g. mental health, healthcare) should we include? And how granular (e.g. misinformation, the Capital Riots) should we get? The Taxonomy Builder Module (TBM) iteratively refines a taxonomy to verify its efficacy and interpretability by AI models -- in other words, that prompts are directed towards the category of guidelines most applicable to them.

The TBM loop, shown in Figure~<a href='#tbmworkflow'>tbmworkflow</a>, is fast and flexible. Given a taxonomy and a dataset of prompts with their labelled category, TBM uses GPT-4 to test the taxonomy against the dataset. Higher performance indicates a more effective taxonomy. A human reviewer then analyzes GPT-4’s miscategorizations, adjusts the wording or structure of the taxonomy accordingly, and repeats. This is similar to how OpenAI builds their content moderation taxonomies. \cite{usinggpt4contentmod}

Once written and run through TBM, the refined taxonomy can then be used in the rest of the Aligned process for better results.

<div id="tbmworkflow" class="flex items-center justify-center">\{\{< image src="images-preprocessed/tbm.png" caption="\textit{TBM Workflow}" zoomable="true" >\}\}</div>


\vspace{-10pt}

\subsection{Classifier}

TBM uses zero and few-shot classification with GPT. Using the topic names and descriptions from the taxonomy, GPT-4 classifies a prompt at the highest level of the taxonomy, and then iteratively works down the tree into more specific categories. For instance, the category of “Elections” could be divided into “Election Results,” “Misinformation,” and “Voting.” If GPT-4 does not choose a subtopic, it will default to the parent topic node.

\subsection{Evaluation}

We test both zero-shot and few-shot structures. For few-shot, we randomly select one prompt in that topic as the example, and then evaluate on all other prompts. We observe 75.4\% accuracy on zero-shot classification and 81.7\% accuracy on few-shot classification.

\section{Runs and Results}

We had 680 people participate on the Aligned platform. Although most were paid crowdworkers (for diversity of perspectives), we had 21 OpenAI GPT-4 redteamers also test the platform and provide feedback. It took under 10 minutes for a person to meaningfully participate. We’re excited by the initial results.

Important to note, we used a basic taxonomy of political issues, shown in Figure~<a href='#tax'>tax</a>. As opposed to a topic like erotic content, political topics stress test the process by impeding consensus.

<div id="tax"></div>

\end{figure}</div>
\vspace{-5pt}

\subsection{Process Run}

On Aligned, most participants would spend their time rating others' guidelines. Nonetheless, there were 330 proposed guidelines. These guidelines, plotted as points by their Guideline Intercept, are shown in Figure~<a href='#gls'>gls</a>. While most guidelines tended towards consensus, many were divisive in the community.

<div id="gls" class="flex items-center justify-center">\{\{< image src="images-preprocessed/guidelines.png" caption="\textit{Guidelines by their divisiveness. Guidelines on the left had more consensus, while guidelines on the right were more divisive.}" zoomable="true" >\}\}</div>


\vspace{-5pt}

Of the 330 proposed guidelines, 30 were approved by the Consensus Algorithm. To give an idea, we show in Figure~<a href='#glexs'>glexs</a> three approved guidelines and one unapproved guideline, as well as the ratings that participants gave each guideline across User embeddings.

Note that these guidelines are principled, but also actionable, opinionated, and direct. We believe this is important to having meaningful constitutions that reach consensus through the melding of opinions, not by generalizing to obscurity.

The 30-guideline constitution at the time of this paper, as well as a list of example guidelines that were not approved, is included in the Appendix. You can view the full, live constitution at \texttt{oai.energize.ai/live}.

\subsection{Post-process Survey}

<div id="survey" class="flex items-center justify-center">\{\{< image src="images-preprocessed/survey.png" caption="\textit{Survey results for four questions, organized by demographic group}" zoomable="true" >\}\}</div>



We also had a portion of the participants (149 random crowdworkers) complete a post-process survey to gather their thoughts and feedback. Notably, because this is a live, real-time platform, they would receive a live copy of the current constitution to use when answering the first survey question. The list of four survey questions was:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Would you say that overall you support the constitution?
\item My Aligned experience was enjoyable or meaningful. (Likert)
\item I would trust Aligned to create a representative constitution for AI. (Likert)
\item My contributions will be used appropriately to create a representative constitution for AI. (Likert)
\end{enumerate}

We tracked the relevant demographic information of each participant, if provided. This allowed us to, in addition to measuring the raw data per question, analyze the data per demographic category and find max-min bridging support. Among other findings, the constitution achieved 93.6\% raw support, with all demographic groups having a minimum of 85\% support. We display the full survey results in Figure~<a href='#survey'>survey</a>, organized by group.

\section{Future Work}

Aligned is a platform for the alignment and governance of AI. This platform-based process can be used for:
-  Evaluation of AI models for bias, edge cases, and other safety issues
-  Understanding needs of users/communities
-  Creating a Productionized Constitution for AI, especially in divisive, grey-area topics
-  Governance frameworks for AI

Although the majority of participants were found through survey platforms for this research, in implementation we foresee integration with naturally formed communities. For instance, we're partnering with Worldcoin to explore integrating our processes. Stay updated online for our upcoming work.
