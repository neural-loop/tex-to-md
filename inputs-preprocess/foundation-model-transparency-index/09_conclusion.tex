Our research establishes the extent to which foundation model developers are transparent, set against the backdrop of decreasing transparency.
Our findings show that the status quo is characterized by a widespread lack of transparency across developers, with significant unevenness in how individual developers fare and where they have room for improvement.
We take this as a serious indictment of the overall ecosystem.
Transparency is a broadly-necessary condition for other more substantive societal progress, and without improvement opaque foundation models are likely to contribute to harm.
Foundation models are being developed, deployed, and adopted at a frenetic pace: for this technology to advance the public interest, real change must be made to rectify the fundamental lack of transparency in the ecosystem.
